This is an implementation of a subset of Python, written because I felt like
writing it. I completed a lexer (though I'm sure there are still bugs) and am
now working on the parser. Once that is done, I may write an interpreter.

The parser is hand-written and does not use a parsing library. This is because
I'm interested in getting the experience of writing a parser for a moderately
complicated language from scratch (I previously hand-wrote a Scheme parser).
